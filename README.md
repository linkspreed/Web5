# Core Functionalities

## Decentralization
At Web5, your files are not stored in a single data center. They are located in a decentralized network and are stored securely and encrypted on computers all over the world.

## Meticulously Designed User Interface & User Experience
In last year of Web5 evolution with help of our users, we spend a lot of time designing gorgeous looking user interface and seamless user experience with our file management frontend. We advocate simplicity and usability.

## Responsive
Meticulously optimized mobile version of Web5, we just love how nice and easy are all components working. Mobile responsive version should be nice and usable as his bigger desktop brother.

## Upload Files
With Web5 you can upload files up to tens of gigabytes, don‚Äôt worry that your big files won‚Äôt be uploaded. We support chunk upload and multipart uploads for your storage. All work seamlessly.

## Folder Upload
For Web5 it isn‚Äôt any problem to upload a folder with your files. The same folder structure will be recreated in the app.

## Sharing Files
With our reach sharing functionalities, you can easily just click on your file or folder, and generate a shared link for everyone. Also you can protect your shared files with your password. 

**Use expiration functionality to automatically expire links, share links directly via email or generate QR code and share it with guys on your left.**

## Shared Pages
If you share any folder with files within, the user has the same user experience as a logged user. He can create folders, name it, upload files or move them into other folders directly in your shared folder.

**Videos have their own dedicated shared page and ability to play video directly in this page with the download button above, try it, it‚Äôs magic!**

## File Request
Do you need a lot of files? Just generate a file request, and send your link for this person. The person can use it to upload files directly into your folder or into your home section for files. The user who‚Äôs uploading files has the same user experience as the internal account.

## Teams
Invite your colleagues or family into your team folders, set their permissions and collaborate together seamlessly.

## Spotlight
With the spotlight, you can search for your users, files, folders, navigate throughout the app, toggle dark mode, toggle emojis and many more from any location in the app. It‚Äôs like magic. Good suit for super users.

## Notification Center
All important events that occur in your account will be recorded in your notifications center. For example, a new team invite, file request was filled, bonus received, billing alert was reached and many more.

## Decentralized Storage Service *(BETA)*
With Storj DCS (Decentralized Cloud Storage) files aren‚Äôt stored in centralized data centers ‚Äî instead, they‚Äôre encrypted, split into pieces, and distributed on a global cloud network.

## Full-Fledged API
You can integrate Web5 into your app seamlessly. You can generate authentication tokens in your profile settings. Documentation for API will come soon.

## 2-Factor Verification
Another layer of security to make sure your files are secured. Users can set up 2 factor verification with their favourite authenticator app.

## Social Logins
Log into your app with your social account. Currently we support Google. More is coming soon.

## Customizable Folder Icons
Set your favourite emoji to your folder as an icon and make Web5 more personal for you! If you are an Apple user, you can switch between Apple emojis and Tweemojis from twitter.
